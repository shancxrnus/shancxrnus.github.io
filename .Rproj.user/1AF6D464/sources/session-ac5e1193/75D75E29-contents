## About me

Hi! I am Shannon, a Year 2 Psychology major who plans to second major in Communications and New Media.
I have zero experience with coding aside from a few experimentations with .html in the past! I am hoping to learn a lot from this course and am excited to learn a new skill. 

I am worried about facing challenges in this course but am determined to find solutions to fix any issues I face!

```
