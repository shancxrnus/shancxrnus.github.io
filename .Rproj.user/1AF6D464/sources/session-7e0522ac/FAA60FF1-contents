## Week 12 Final Diary Entry

## **(1)** Reflect on your experience doing the project using R
Having never touched R and having little experience in coding as a whole, this module was challenging but at the same time motivating for me to learn a new skill. The lectures equipped me with the basic foundational skills which are important to understand in order to be flexible with my code for this project but the previous assignments have equipped me with the habit to look outside of the syllabus for new skills to learn. Taking the time to outside of the syllabus encouraged me to engage in trial and error even if there is a risk of failure. However, I did find myself getting ambitious at times which caused me to be stuck as I tried to force myself to answer a question that may not be feasible. My original problem statement required me to showcase every major for each university in the data visualisation, however, it ended up making the graph really messy which defeated the purpose of my data story. This resulted in me having to backtrack and re-view the framing of the problem statement into a more feasible one. Sometimes taking a few steps back allows us to make more leaps forward. 

## **(2)** What have you learned in NM2207, and how can that be helpful in your future career? 
I have learnt how to identify and solve key issues while coding in NM2207 and trained myself to be more meticulous. Asking questions when necessary is also something I have learnt to be essential when it comes to problem-solving and looking outside the box. These are all soft skills that can be applied to my future career and everyday life. Learning troubleshooting skills is essential to being adaptable in the face of challenges in my future career. The coding skills learnt here may also be transferrable and applicable for other coding languages or applications, and this will allow me to pick up new coding languages more easily by equating it to what I have learnt before.

## **(3)** Try to identify use-cases within your specialization and future industry that you might benefit by using R.
As a psychology major, I have had previous experience in R specifically for the presentation of datasets. Now with a better understanding of how to make data tidy and how to customise the organisation data to get the necessary information, I can apply this for future data visualisations needed for statistical analysis. I can also make interactive applications for easier analysis of data, this would also be useful for not only psychology majors or researchers to observe data but also layman. It could also perhaps be used for advanced statistical analyses. R may also be a good platform for us to document the research process alongside the data as it has the ability to create websites with interactive apps. I can imagine that shiny can also be used to create memory games and the like that may be required in cognitive psychology experiments.
