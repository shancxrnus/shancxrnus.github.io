**Introduction**

Hello! I'm Shannon Chua and I'm currently a Year 2 Psychology student who is second majoring in Communications and New Media. For my final project, I am interested in understanding the changes and trends in lifetime prevalence of mental health disorders in Singapore over the years.

**Identified Dataset for Data Story**

A dataset I have identified to check the trends is from ourworldindata.org:\
<https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#all-charts>

In which the data used in the website is obtained from IHME, Global Burden of Disease Study (2019) – processed by Our World in Data.

The data ranges from 1990 to 2019.
