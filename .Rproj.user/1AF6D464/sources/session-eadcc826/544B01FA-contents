**Introduction**

Hello! I'm Shannon Chua and I'm currently a Year 2 Psychology student who is second majoring in Communications and New Media. For my final project, I am interested in understanding the changes and trends in lifetime prevalence of mental health disorders in Singapore over the years.

**Identified Dataset for Data Story**

A dataset I have identified is from data.gov.sg. It is a dataset from the Graduate Employment Survey conducted by NTU, NUS, SMU, SIT (from 2014), SUTD (from 2015) and SUSS (from 2018) annually. The data ranges from 2013 to 2021.\

My problem statement is: How have the employment rate and starting salary of Singaporean university graduates changed over time for different majors from 2013 to 2021?
